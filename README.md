5. ### What is the purpose of the array slice method

   The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
   ```

   **Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

6. ### What is the purpose of the array splice method

   The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
   ```

   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice

   Some of the major difference in a tabular form

   | Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
   | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
   | Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
   | Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array |

9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators

   JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
      null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

   Some of the example which covers the above cases,

   ```javascript
   0 == false   // true
   0 === false  // false
   1 == "1"     // true
   1 === "1"    // false
   null == undefined // true
   null === undefined // false
   '0' == false // true
   '0' === false // false
   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
   ```

10. ### What are lambda or arrow functions

    An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

11. ### What is a first class function

    In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

    ```javascript
    const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
    document.addEventListener("click", handler);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is a higher order function

    Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrderFunc = () =>
      console.log("Hello, I am a First order function");
    const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
    higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is the currying function

    Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

    Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

    ```javascript
    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
    ```

    Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

16. ### What is a pure function

    A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

    ```javascript
    //Impure
    let numberArray = [];
    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
    //Pure
    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
      argNumberArray.concat([number]);

    //Display the results
    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    ```

    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

17. ### What is the purpose of the let keyword

    The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

    Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

    ```javascript
    let counter = 30;
    if (counter === 30) {
      let counter = 31;
      console.log(counter); // 31
    }
    console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is the difference between let and var

    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var                                                   | let                         |
    | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
    | It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
    | Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,

    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
      if (username) {
        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
        let age = 30;
        var salary = 10000;
      }
      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    userDetails("John");
    ```

21. ### What is the Temporal Dead Zone

    The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

    Let's see this behavior with an example,

    ```javascript
    function somemethod() {
      console.log(counter1); // undefined
      console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
      var counter1 = 1;
      let counter2 = 2;
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

22. ### What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      // logic here
    })();
    ```

    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      var message = "IIFE";
      console.log(message);
    })();
    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

24. ### What is memoization

    Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

    ```javascript
    const memoizAddition = () => {
      let cache = {};
      return (value) => {
        if (value in cache) {
          console.log("Fetching from cache");
          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
        } else {
          console.log("Calculating result");
          let result = value + 20;
          cache[value] = result;
          return result;
        }
      };
    };
    // returned function from memoizAddition
    const addition = memoizAddition();
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25. ### What is Hoisting

    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

    ```javascript
    console.log(message); //output : undefined
    var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

    ```javascript
    var message;
    console.log(message);
    message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

    ```javascript
    message("Good morning"); //Good morning

    function message(name) {
      console.log(name);
    }
    ```

    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26. ### What are classes in ES6

    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

    ```javascript
    function Bike(model, color) {
      this.model = model;
      this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
      return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
    };
    ```

    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

    ```javascript
    class Bike {
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
      }
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What are closures

    A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
    2. Outer function’s variables
    3. Global variables

    Let's take an example of closure concept,

    ```javascript
    function Welcome(name) {
      var greetingInfo = function (message) {
        console.log(message + " " + name);
      };
      return greetingInfo;
    }
    var myFunction = Welcome("John");
    myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
    myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
    ```

    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

28. ### What are modules

    Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### Why do you need modules

    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

    1. Maintainability
    2. Reusability
    3. Namespacing

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### What is scope in javascript

    Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

35. ### What is web storage

    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### What is a post message

    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is a Cookie

    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John";
    ```

    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### Why do you need a Cookie

    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

    1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39. ### What are the options in a cookie

    There are few below options available for a cookie,

    1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
    ```

    1. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

40. ### How do you delete a cookie

    You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
    For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie =
      "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
    ```

    **Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

    | Feature                           | Cookie                             | Local storage    | Session storage     |
    | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side     | client-side only | client-side only    |
    | Lifetime                          | As configured using Expires option | until deleted    | until tab is closed |
    | SSL support                       | Supported                          | Not supported    | Not supported       |
    | Maximum data size                 | 4KB                                | 5 MB             | 5MB                 |

42. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage

    LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43. ### How do you access web storage

    The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).
    For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
    localStorage.getItem("logo");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44. ### What are the methods available on session storage

    The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

    ```javascript
    // Save data to sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

    // Get saved data from sessionStorage
    let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

    // Remove saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

    // Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.clear();
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

45. ### What is a storage event and its event handler

    The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events.
    The syntax would be as below

    ```javascript
    window.onstorage = functionRef;
    ```

    Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

    ```javascript
    window.onstorage = function (e) {
      console.log(
        "The " +
          e.key +
          " key has been changed from " +
          e.oldValue +
          " to " +
          e.newValue +
          "."
      );
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### Why do you need web storage

    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

51. ### What is a promise

    A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

    The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // promise description
    });
    ```

    The usage of a promise would be as below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(
      (resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("I'm a Promise!");
        }, 5000);
      },
      (reject) => {}
    );

    promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
    ```

    The action flow of a promise will be as below,

    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### Why do you need a promise

    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### What are the three states of promise

    Promises have three states:

    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### What is a callback function

    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

    ```javascript
    function callbackFunction(name) {
      console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    function outerFunction(callback) {
      let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
      callback(name);
    }

    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Why do we need callbacks

    The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

    ```javascript
    function firstFunction() {
      // Simulate a code delay
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("First function called");
      }, 1000);
    }
    function secondFunction() {
      console.log("Second function called");
    }
    firstFunction();
    secondFunction();

    Output;
    // Second function called
    // First function called
    ```

    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

56. ### What is a callback hell

    Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

    ```javascript
    async1(function(){
        async2(function(){
            async3(function(){
                async4(function(){
                    ....
                });
            });
        });
    });
    ```

61. ### What are the main rules of promise

    A promise must follow a specific set of rules,

    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

62. ### What is callback in callback

    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

    ```javascript
    loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
      console.log("first script is loaded");

      loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
        console.log("second script is loaded");

        loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
          console.log("third script is loaded");
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });
      });
    });
    ```

63. ### What is promise chaining

    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

    ```javascript
    new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
    })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 1
        return result * 2;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 2
        return result * 3;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 6
        return result * 4;
      });
    ```

    In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

    1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
    2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \* 2.
    3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result \* 3.
    4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64. ### What is promise.all

    Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

    ```javascript
    Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
    ```

    **Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### What is the purpose of the race method in promise

    Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

    ```javascript
    var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
    });
    var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
    });

    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
      console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
    });
    ```

66. ### What is a strict mode in javascript

    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### Why do you need strict mode

    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68. ### How do you declare strict mode

    The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
    ```

    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

    ```javascript
    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
    myFunction();

    function myFunction() {
      "use strict";
      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
    }
    ```

70. ### What is the purpose of the delete operator

    The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

    ```javascript
    var user = { name: "John", age: 20 };
    delete user.age;

    console.log(user); // {name: "John"}
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71. ### What is the typeof operator

    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### What is undefined property

    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

    ```javascript
    var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    console.log(typeof user); //undefined
    ```

    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

    ```javascript
    user = undefined;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

73. ### What is null value

    The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
    You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

    ```javascript
    var user = null;
    console.log(typeof user); //object
    ```

74. ### What is the difference between null and undefined

    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

    | Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
    | Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

76. ### What is the difference between window and document

    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

77. ### How do you access history in javascript

    The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.

    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back();
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward();
    }
    ```

    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

79. ### What is isNaN

    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

    ```javascript
    isNaN("Hello"); //true
    isNaN("100"); //false
    ```

80. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

    Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

    | undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

81. ### What are global variables

    Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

    ```javascript
    msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82. ### What are the problems with global variables

    The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

83. ### What is NaN property

    The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

    ```javascript
    Math.sqrt(-1);
    parseInt("Hello");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

84. ### What is the purpose of isFinite function

    The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

    ```javascript
    isFinite(Infinity); // false
    isFinite(NaN); // false
    isFinite(-Infinity); // false

    isFinite(100); // true
    ```

85. ### What is an event flow

    Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.
    There are two ways of event flow

    1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
    2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86. ### What is event bubbling

    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### What is event capturing

    Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

88. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

    ```javascript
    function submit() {
      document.forms[0].submit();
    }
    ```

93. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks

    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

    **Pros:**

    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

    **Cons:**

    1. It makes little complex code
    2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```

    You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```

    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

100. ### What are events

     Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

     1. Web page has finished loading
     2. Input field was changed
     3. Button was clicked

     Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

     ```javascript
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          function greeting() {
            alert('Hello! Good morning');
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
      </body>
     </html>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

     The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

     ```javascript
     document
       .getElementById("link")
       .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
         event.preventDefault();
       });
     ```

     **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout

     The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval

     The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

     ```javascript
     setInterval(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

     JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

110. ### What is ECMAScript

     ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

111. ### What is JSON

     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

     Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

     1. The data is in name/value pairs
     2. The data is separated by commas
     3. Curly braces hold objects
     4. Square brackets hold arrays

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

     When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

     ```javascript
     var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
     var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
     console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### How do you parse JSON string

     When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

     ```javascript
     var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
     var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
     console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### Why do you need JSON

     When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

     The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

     For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearTimeout(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

     The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

     For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearInterval(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

119. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

     In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     function redirect() {
       window.location.href = "newPage.html";
     }
     ```

120. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

     There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.includes(subString);
     ```

     1. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
     ```

     1. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       regex = /hell/;
     regex.test(mainString);
     ```

121. ### How do you validate an email in javascript

     You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.

     ```javascript
     function validateEmail(email) {
       var re =
         /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
       return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
     }
     ```

122. ### How do you get the current url with javascript

     You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

     ```javascript
     console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
     ```

124. ### How do get query string values in javascript

     You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

     ```javascript
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const clientCode = urlParams.get("clientCode");
     ```

129. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase

     You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

     ```javascript
     function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
       return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
     }
     ```

131. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

     You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

     ```javascript
     var today = new Date();
     var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
     var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
     var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

     today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
     document.write(today);
     ```

132. ### How do you compare two date objects

     You need to use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead of comparison operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)

     ```javascript
     var d1 = new Date();
     var d2 = new Date(d1);
     console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
     console.log(d1 === d2); // False
     ```

133. ### How do you check if a string starts with another string

     You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,

     ```javascript
     "Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
     "Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

134. ### How do you trim a string in javascript

     JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

     ```javascript
     "  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
     ```

     If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

     ```javascript
     if (!String.prototype.trim) {
       (function () {
         // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
         var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
         String.prototype.trim = function () {
           return this.replace(rtrim, "");
         };
       })();
     }
     ```

149. ### How do you generate random integers

     You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

     ```javascript
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     ```

     **Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

154. ### What is a Regular Expression

     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

     ```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
     ```

     For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

     ```javascript
     /John/i;
     ```

161. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

     You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript

     1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
     ```

     1. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
     ```

162. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

     The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.

173. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript

     The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statements.

     ```javascript
     var isAuthenticated = false;
     console.log(
       isAuthenticated ? "Hello, welcome" : "Sorry, you are not authenticated"
     ); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
     ```

     The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new

     ```javascript
     new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
     new Employee().prototype === undefined;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

185. ### What is a rest parameter

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function total(…args){
     let sum = 0;
     for(let i of args){
     sum+=i;
     }
     return sum;
     }
     console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
     console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

186. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

     The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

     ```javascript
     function someFunc(a,…b,c){
     //You code goes here
     return;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

188. ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

192. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

     You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     Object.assign(target, ...sources);
     ```

     Let's take example with one source and one target object,

     ```javascript
     const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

     const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

     console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

     console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
     ```

     As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

214. ### What is an anonymous function

     An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function (optionalParameters) {
       //do something
     }

     const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
       //do something
     };

     [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
       //do something
     });
     ```

     Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

     ```javascript
     var x = function (a, b) {
       return a * b;
     };
     var z = x(5, 10);
     console.log(z); // 50
     ```

215. ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

     A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Good morning";
     function greeting() {
       msg = "Good Evening";
       console.log(msg);
     }
     greeting();
     ```

216. ### What are javascript accessors

     ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

     ```javascript
     var user = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName : "Abraham",
       language : "en",
       get lang() {
         return this.language;
       }
       set lang(lang) {
       this.language = lang;
       }
     };
     console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
     user.lang = 'fr';
     console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

219. ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters

     Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,

     1. They provide simpler syntax
     2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
     3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
     4. They can provide better data quality
     5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

223. ### What are primitive data types

     A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

     1. string
     2. number
     3. boolean
     4. null
     5. undefined
     6. bigint
     7. symbol

229. ### What are the various statements in error handling

     Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

     1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
     2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
     3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
     4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

230. ### What are the two types of loops in javascript

     1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
     2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

236. ### What is an event loop

     The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function has finished executing the code.
     **Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

237. ### What is call stack

     Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

     Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

     ```javascript
     function hungry() {
       eatFruits();
     }
     function eatFruits() {
       return "I'm eating fruits";
     }

     // Invoke the `hungry` function
     hungry();
     ```

     The above code processed in a call stack as below,

     1. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     2. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     3. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
     4. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

242. ### How do you sort elements in an array

     The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The example usage would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
     months.sort();
     console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

243. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays

     The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value. Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

244. ### How do you reversing an array

     You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     numbers.reverse();
     console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
     ```

245. ### How do you find min and max value in an array

     You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
     }
     function findMax(arr) {
       return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

246. ### How do you find min and max values without Math functions

     You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var min = Infinity;
       while (length--) {
         if (arr[length] < min) {
           min = arr[len];
         }
       }
       return min;
     }

     function findMax(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var max = -Infinity;
       while (len--) {
         if (arr[length] > max) {
           max = arr[length];
         }
       }
       return max;
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

249. ### What is a comma operator

     The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var x = 1;
     x = (x++, x);

     console.log(x); // 2
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

250. ### What is the advantage of a comma operator

     It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

     ```javascript
     for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
     ```

     You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var a = 1;
       return (a += 10), a; // 11
     }
     ```

272. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript

     JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
     Lets' perform user login in an html form,

     ```html
     <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
       User name: <input type="text" name="uname" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     And the validation on user login is below,

     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
       var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
       if (x == "") {
         alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

273. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript

     You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

     ```html
     <form method="post">
       <input type="text" name="uname" required />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

295. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

     If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

     1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
     2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
     3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

296. ### What is jQuery

     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function () {
       // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
       alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
     });
     ```

     **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

298. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

     ```javascript
     let age = 50; // age is a number now
     age = "old"; // age is a string now
     age = true; // age is a boolean
     ```

303. ### What is the output of below for loops

     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // global scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }

     for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // block scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }
     ```

     The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

     **Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`.

     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.

305. ### What is ES6

     ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

306. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables

     No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

     ```bash
     Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
     ```

     **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

     ```javascript
     var name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       var name = "Nick";
       var name = "Abraham"; // Re-assigned in the same function block
       alert(name); // Abraham
     }
     myFunc();
     alert(name); // John
     ```

     The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

     ```javascript
     let name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       let name = "Nick";
       let name = "Abraham"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
       alert(name);
     }

     myFunc();
     alert(name);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

307. ### Is const variable makes the value immutable

     No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

     ```javascript
     const userList = [];
     userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
     console.log(userList); // ['John']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

308. ### What are default parameters

     In E5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

     ```javascript
     //ES5
     var calculateArea = function (height, width) {
       height = height || 50;
       width = width || 60;

       return width * height;
     };
     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {
       return width * height;
     };

     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309. ### What are template literals

     Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
     In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
     ```

     In ES5, you need break string like below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
     ```

     **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

310. ### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals

     In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

     ```javascript
     console.log("This is string sentence 1\n" + "This is string sentence 2");
     ```

     Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

     ```javascript
     console.log(`This is string sentence
     'This is string sentence 2`);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311. ### What are nesting templates

     The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

     ```javascript
     const iconStyles = `icon ${
       isMobilePlatform()
         ? ""
         : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? "submit" : "disabled"}`
     }`;
     ```

     You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

     ```javascript
     //Without nesting templates
      const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :
       (user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

312. ### What are tagged templates

     Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

     ```javascript
     var user1 = "John";
     var skill1 = "JavaScript";
     var experience1 = 15;

     var user2 = "Kane";
     var skill2 = "JavaScript";
     var experience2 = 5;

     function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
       var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
       var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
       var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

       var expertiseStr;
       if (experienceExp > 10) {
         expertiseStr = "expert developer";
       } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
         expertiseStr = "senior developer";
       } else {
         expertiseStr = "junior developer";
       }

       return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
     }

     var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;
     var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;

     console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
     console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

313. ### What are raw strings

     ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \n${
       1 + 2 + 3 + 4
     }!`;
     console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is 10
     ```

     If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

     ```javascript
     var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;
     console.log(calculationString);
     // The sum of numbers is
     // 10
     ```

     Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function

     ```javascript
     function tag(strings) {
       console.log(strings.raw[0]);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

314. ### What is destructuring assignment

     The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
     Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

     ```javascript
     var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

     console.log(one); // "JAN"
     console.log(two); // "FEB"
     console.log(three); // "MARCH"
     ```

     and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

     console.log(name); // John
     console.log(age); // 32
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

315. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment

     A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

     **Arrays destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var x, y, z;

     [x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **Objects destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

316. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

     If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;

     [x, y] = [y, x];
     console.log(x); // 20
     console.log(y); // 10
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

317. ### What are enhanced object literals

     Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.

     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;
     obj = { x, y };
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     //ES5
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;
     obj = { x: x, y: y };
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

318. ### What are dynamic imports

     The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.
     The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

     ```javascript
     import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

319. ### What are the use cases for dynamic imports

     Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,

     1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser

     ```javascript
     if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
         import(···)
         .then(···);
     }
     ```

     1. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.

     ```javascript
     import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);
     ```

     1. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

320. ### What are typed arrays

     Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 8 Typed array types,

     1. Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
     2. Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
     3. Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
     4. Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
     5. Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
     6. Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
     7. Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
     8. Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers

     For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

     ```javascript
     const a = new Int8Array();
     // You can pre-allocate n bytes
     const bytes = 1024;
     const a = new Int8Array(bytes);
     ```

321. ### What are the advantages of module loaders

     The module loaders provides the below features,

     1. Dynamic loading
     2. State isolation
     3. Global namespace isolation
     4. Compilation hooks
     5. Nested virtualization

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

322. ### What is collation

     Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,

     1. **Comparison:**

     ```javascript
     var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(l10nDE.compare("ä", "z") === -1); // true
     console.log(l10nSV.compare("ä", "z") === +1); // true
     ```

     1. **Sorting:**

     ```javascript
     var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)); // [ "a", "ä", "z" ]
     console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)); // [ "a", "z", "ä" ]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

323. ### What is for...of statement

     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

     for (let value of arrayIterable) {
       value++;
       console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

324. ### What is the output of below spread operator array

     ```javascript
     [..."John Resig"];
     ```

     The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']
     **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

325. ### Is PostMessage secure

     Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

326. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard

     The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

     ```javascript
     targetWindow.postMessage(message, "*");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

327. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers

     Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),

     ```javascript
     //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
     window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
         if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
              console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
        }
     });
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

328. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely

     You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

329. ### Is postMessages synchronous

     The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

330. ### What paradigm is Javascript

     JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

331. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript

     **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag.
     **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

332. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script

     Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side script. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

333. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox

     You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `True` means the checkbox is checked otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below,

     ```html
     <input type="checkbox" name="checkboxname" value="Agree" /> Agree the
     conditions<br />
     ```

     ```javascript
     console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false
     ```

334. ### What is the purpose of double tilde operator

     The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is going to be a quicker substitute for Math.floor().

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

335. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code

     You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,

     ```javascript
     "ABC".charCodeAt(0); // returns 65
     ```

     Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

     ```javascript
     String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns 'ABC'
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

336. ### What is ArrayBuffer

     An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,

     ```javascript
     let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
     alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
     ```

     To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.

     ```javascript
     //Create a DataView referring to the buffer
     let view = new DataView(buffer);
     ```

337. ### What is the output of below string expression

     ```javascript
     console.log("Welcome to JS world"[0]);
     ```

     The output of the above expression is "W".
     **Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character "W" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

338. ### What is the purpose of Error object

     The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

     ```javascript
     new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```

     You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

     ```javascript
     try {
       if (withdraw > balance)
         throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.name + ": " + e.message);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

339. ### What is the purpose of EvalError object

     The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global `eval()` function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,

     ```javascript
     new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```

     You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,

     ```javascript
     try {
       throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // "Eval function error", "EvalError", "someFile.js"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

340. ### What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode

     When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script

     1. When you use Octal syntax

     ```javascript
     var n = 022;
     ```

     1. Using `with` statement
     2. When you use delete operator on a variable name
     3. Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name
     4. When you use newly reserved keywords
     5. When you declare a function in a block

     ```javascript
     if (someCondition) {
       function f() {}
     }
     ```

     Hence, the errors from above cases are helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.

341. ### Do all objects have prototypes

     No. All objects have prototypes except for the base object which is created by the user, or an object that is created using the new keyword.

342. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument

     Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

     ```javascript
     function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
       console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
       console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
     }
     myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");
     ```

343. ### What is the purpose of some method in arrays

     The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

     var odd = (element) => element % 2 !== 0;

     console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)
     ```

344. ### How do you combine two or more arrays

     The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
     ```

     Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

     ```javascript
     var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
     var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
     var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
     console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears
     ```

345. ### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy

     There are two ways to copy an object,

     **Shallow Copy:**
     Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     to create a duplicate

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
     ```

     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

     ```javascript
     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
     ```

     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

     **Deep copy:**
     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
       name: empDetails.name,
       age: empDetails.age,
       expertise: empDetails.expertise,
     };
     ```

     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

346. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string

     The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
     Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

     ```javascript
     "Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
     ```

347. ### How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression

     The `matchAll()` method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,

     ```javascript
     let regexp = /Hello(\d?))/g;
     let greeting = "Hello1Hello2Hello3";

     let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

     console.log(greetingList[0]); //Hello1
     console.log(greetingList[1]); //Hello2
     console.log(greetingList[2]); //Hello3
     ```

348. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending

     The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

     console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

     console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     ```

349. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator

     Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+"Hello");
     ```

     The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

350. ### Does javascript uses mixins

     Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one `[[prototype]]` for an object.

     But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.

     Say for instance, we've two classes `User` and `CleanRoom`. Suppose we need to add `CleanRoom` functionality to `User`, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.

     ```javascript
     // mixin
     let cleanRoomMixin = {
       cleanRoom() {
         alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);
       },
       sayBye() {
         alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
       },
     };

     // usage:
     class User {
       constructor(name) {
         this.name = name;
       }
     }

     // copy the methods
     Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

     // now User can clean the room
     new User("Dude").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!
     ```

351. ### What is a thunk function

     A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

     ```javascript
     const add = (x, y) => x + y;

     const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

     thunk(); // 5
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

352. ### What are asynchronous thunks

     The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

     ```javascript
     function fetchData(fn) {
       fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
         .then((response) => response.json())
         .then((json) => fn(json));
     }

     const asyncThunk = function () {
       return fetchData(function getData(data) {
         console.log(data);
       });
     };

     asyncThunk();
     ```

     The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

353. ### What is the output of below function calls

     **Code snippet:**

     ```javascript
     const circle = {
       radius: 20,
       diameter() {
         return this.radius * 2;
       },
       perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
     };
     ```
     
     ```javascript
     console.log(circle.diameter());
     console.log(circle.perimeter());
     ```

     **Output:**

     The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

354. ### How to remove all line breaks from a string

     The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.

     ```javascript
     function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
         return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
     }
     ```

     In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

355. ### What is the difference between reflow and repaint

     A _repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

356. ### What happens with negating an array

     Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.

     ```javascript
     console.log(![]); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

357. ### What happens if we add two arrays

     If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(["a"] + ["b"]); // "ab"
     console.log([] + []); // ""
     console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
     ```

358. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values

     If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+null); // 0
     console.log(+undefined); // NaN
     console.log(+false); // 0
     console.log(+NaN); // NaN
     console.log(+""); // 0
     ```

359. ### How do you create self string using special characters

     The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.

     1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
     2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
     3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1

     By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions

     ```javascript
     (![] + [] === "false" + !+[]) === 1;
     ```

     Now the character pattern would be created as below,

     ```javascript
           s               e               l               f
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+[]]
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]
     ```

360. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array

     You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

     ```javascript
     const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];
     myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
     ```

361. ### How do you get unique values of an array

     You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.

     ```javascript
     console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
     ```

362. ### What is destructuring aliases

     Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.

     ```javascript
     const obj = { x: 1 };
     // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
     const { x: otherName } = obj;
     ```

363. ### How do you map the array values without using map method

     You can map the array values without using the `map` method by just using the `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,

     ```javascript
     const countries = [
       { name: "India", capital: "Delhi" },
       { name: "US", capital: "Washington" },
       { name: "Russia", capital: "Moscow" },
       { name: "Singapore", capital: "Singapore" },
       { name: "China", capital: "Beijing" },
       { name: "France", capital: "Paris" },
     ];

     const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital }) => capital);
     console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']
     ```

366. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

     You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.

     ```javascript
     var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
     var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };
     console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}

368. ### What are the placeholders from console object

     Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,

     1. %o — It takes an object,
     2. %s — It takes a string,
     3. %d — It is used for a decimal or integer
        These placeholders can be represented in the console.log as below

     ```javascript
     const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
     console.log(
       "Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form",
       "John",
       user
     ); // Hello John, your details {name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi"} are available in object

     Yes, you can apply CSS styles to console messages similar to html text on the web page.

     ```javascript
     console.log(
       "%c The text has blue color, with large font and red background",
       "color: blue; font-size: x-large; background: red"
     );
     ```

     The text will be displayed as below,

372. ### How do you display data in a tabular format using console object

     The `console.table()` is used to display data in the console in a tabular format to visualize complex arrays or objects.

     ```js
     const users = [
       { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" },
       { name: "Max", id: 2, city: "London" },
       { name: "Rod", id: 3, city: "Paris" },
     ];
     console.table(users);
     ```

374. ### How do you create copy to clipboard button

     You need to select the content(using .select() method) of the input element and execute the copy command with execCommand (i.e, execCommand('copy')). You can also execute other system commands like cut and paste.

     ```javascript
     document.querySelector("#copy-button").onclick = function () {
       // Select the content
       document.querySelector("#copy-input").select();
       // Copy to the clipboard

376. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays

     Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

     ```javascript
     const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
     const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

     But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

     ```javascript
     function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
       const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
       return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
         ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)
         : flattened;
     }
     const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
     const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

377. ### What is the easiest multi condition checking

     You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.

     ```javascript
     // Verbose approach
     if (
       input === "first" ||
       input === 1 ||
       input === "second" ||
       input === 2
     ) {
       someFunction();
     }
     // Shortcut
     if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
       someFunction();
     }
     ```

380. ### What are wrapper objects

     Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.

     ```javascript
     let name = "john";

     console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());
     ```

     i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

381. ### What is AJAX

     AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

383. ### How to cancel a fetch request

     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
        For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,

     ```javascript
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
     ```

384. ### What is web speech API

     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,

     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.
        The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,

     ```javascript
     window.SpeechRecognition =
       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
     recognition.onresult = (event) => {
       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
       console.log(speechToText);
     };
     recognition.start();
     ```

     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

     1. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,

     ```javascript
     if ("speechSynthesis" in window) {
       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
       speech.lang = "en-US";
       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
     }
     ```

     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

385. ### What is minimum timeout throttling

     Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.
     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.
     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.
     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.
     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output would be in

     ```cmd
     Script loaded
     My script is initialized
     ```

     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     runMeFirst();
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output is,

     ```cmd
     My script is initialized
     Script loaded
     ```

386. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers

     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

387. ### What are tasks in event loop

     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

388. ### What is microtask

     Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until the microtask queue is empty.
     The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

391. ### How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file

     It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in our TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

     ```javascript
     declare var customLibrary;
     ```

     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

     ```javascript
     var customLibrary: any;
     ```

392. ### What are the differences between promises and observables

     Some of the major difference in a tabular form

     | Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
     | Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |
     | Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |
     | Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |
     | Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |

393. ### What is heap

     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

394. ### What is an event table

     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.
     It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

395. ### What is a microTask queue

     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.
     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

396. ### What is the difference between shim and polyfill

     A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
     In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

397. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type

     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

     ```javascript
     var myPrimitive = 30;
     var myNonPrimitive = {};
     function isPrimitive(val) {
       return Object(val) !== val;
     }

     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
     ```

     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

398. ### What is babel

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

399. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded

     Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

401. ### What is RxJS

     RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for implementing reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

402. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return new Function("return a;");
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```

     **Function declaration:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return function func() {
         return a;
       };
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

403. ### What is a Short circuit condition

     Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,

     ```javascript
     if (authenticate) {
       loginToPorta();
     }
     ```

     Since the javascript logical operators evaluated from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator

     ```javascript
     authenticate && loginToPorta();
     ```

404. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array

     The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(array.length); // 5

     array.length = 2;
     console.log(array.length); // 2
     console.log(array); // [1,2]
     ```

     and the array can be emptied too

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     array.length = 0;
     console.log(array.length); // 0
     console.log(array); // []
     ```

405. ### What is an observable

     An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.
     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable

     ```javascript
     import { Observable } from "rxjs";

     const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         observer.next("Message from a Observable!");
       }, 3000);
     });

     observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
     ```

     ![Screenshot](images/observables.png)

     **Note:** Observables are not part of the JavaScript language yet but they are being proposed to be added to the language

406. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations

     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.

     **Classes:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```

     **Constructor Function:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // No error

     function User() {}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

407. ### What is an async function

     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```javascript
     async function logger() {
       let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data);
     }
     logger();
     ```

     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

408. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors

     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       throw new Error("error");
     });
     ```

     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value")
          .then(function () {
            throw new Error("error");
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
            console.error(error.stack);
          });
        ```

        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
          throw new Error("error");
        });
        ```

        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp()
          .then(function (result) {
            return processDataAsync(result);
          })
          .done(function (processed) {
            displayData(processed);
          });
        ```

        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
        });
        ```

        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.

     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**
        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

        ```javascript
        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {
          throw error;
        });
        ```

        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

        ```javascript
        Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {});
        ```

410. ### How do you make an object iterable in javascript

     By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.

     Let's demonstrate this with an example,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]() {
         const values = Object.keys(this);
         let i = 0;
         return {
           next: () => {
             return {
               value: this[values[i++]],
               done: i > values.length,
             };
           },
         };
       },
     };

     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
         for (let key in this) {
           yield this[key];
         }
       },
     };
     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

411. ### What is a Proper Tail Call

     First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return 1;
       }
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return acc;
       }
       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

412. ### How do you check an object is a promise or not

     If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(object) {
       if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {
         return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
       } else {
         throw "Promise not supported in your environment";
       }
     }

     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

     Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(value) {
       return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === "function");
     }
     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

413. ### How to detect if a function is called as constructor

     You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

     1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
     2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.

     ```javascript
     function Myfunc() {
        if (new.target) {
           console.log('called with new');
        } else {
           console.log('not called with new');
        }
     }

     new Myfunc(); // called with new
     Myfunc(); // not called with new
     Myfunc.call({}); not called with new
     ```

414. ### What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter

     There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

     1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
     2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
     3. The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

415. ### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

     Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

416. ### What are the different kinds of generators

     There are five kinds of generators,

     1. **Generator function declaration:**

        ```javascript
        function* myGenFunc() {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        }
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     2. **Generator function expressions:**

        ```javascript
        const myGenFunc = function* () {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        };
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     3. **Generator method definitions in object literals:**

        ```javascript
        const myObj = {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };
        const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     4. **Generator method definitions in class:**

        ```javascript
        class MyClass {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          }
        }
        const myObject = new MyClass();
        const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     5. **Generator as a computed property:**

        ```javascript
        const SomeObj = {
          *[Symbol.iterator]() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };

        console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        ```

417. ### What are the built-in iterables

     Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

     1. Arrays and TypedArrays
     2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
     3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
     4. Sets: iterates over their elements
     5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
     6. DOM collection such as NodeList

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

418. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

     Let's explain this difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     let arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

     arr.newProp = "newVlue";

     // key are the property keys
     for (let key in arr) {
       console.log(key);
     }

     // value are the property values
     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value);
     }
     ```

     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

419. ### How do you define instance and non-instance properties

     The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined insider constructor as below,

     ```javascript
     class Person {
       constructor(name, age) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = age;
       }
     }
     ```

     But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

     ```javascript
     Person.staticAge = 30;
     Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

420. ### What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?

     1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
     2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.

     Let's see the difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     isNaN(‘hello’);   // true
     Number.isNaN('hello'); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

421. ### How to invoke an IIFE without any extra brackets?

     Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) requires a pair of parenthesis to wrap the function which contains set of statements.

     ```js
     (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

     Since both IIFE and void operator discard the result of an expression, you can avoid the extra brackets using `void operator` for IIFE as below,

     ```js
     void (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

422. ### Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?

     You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

     ```js
     const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
       switch (true) {
         case temp < 0:
           return "freezing";
         case temp < 10:
           return "cold";
         case temp < 24:
           return "cool";
         default:
           return "unknown";
       }
     })(10);
     ```

423. ### What is the easiest way to ignore promise errors?

     The easiest and safest way to ignore promise errors is void that error. This approach is ESLint friendly too.

     ```js
     await promise.catch((e) => void e);
     ```

424. ### How do style the console output using CSS?

     You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red the color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,

     ```js
     console.log("%cThis is a red text", "color:red");
     ```

     It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text

     ```js
     console.log(
       "%cThis is a red text with bigger font",
       "color:red; font-size:20px"
     );
     ```

425. ### What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?

     It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.

     ```js
     console.log(null ?? true); // true
     console.log(false ?? true); // false
     console.log(undefined ?? true); // true
     ```

426. ### How do you group and nest console output?

     The `console.group()` can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.

     For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:

     ```js
     console.group("User Details");
     console.log("name: Sudheer Jonna");
     console.log("job: Software Developer");

     // Nested Group
     console.group("Address");
     console.log("Street: Commonwealth");
     console.log("City: Los Angeles");
     console.log("State: California");

     console.groupEnd();
     ```

     You can also use `console.groupCollapsed()` instead of `console.group()` if you want the groups to be collapsed by default.

427. ### What is the difference between dense and sparse arrays?

     An array contains items at each index starting from first(0) to last(array.length - 1) is called as Dense array. Whereas if at least one item is missing at any index, the array is called as sparse.

     Let's see the below two kind of arrays,

     ```js
     const avengers = ["Ironman", "Hulk", "CaptainAmerica"];
     console.log(avengers[0]); // 'Ironman'
     console.log(avengers[1]); // 'Hulk'
     console.log(avengers[2]); // 'CaptainAmerica'
     console.log(avengers.length); // 3

     const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
     console.log(justiceLeague[0]); // 'Superman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[1]); // 'Aquaman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[2]); // undefined
     console.log(justiceLeague[3]); // 'Batman'
     console.log(justiceLeague.length); // 4
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

428. ### What are the different ways to create sparse arrays?

     There are 4 different ways to create sparse arrays in JavaScript

     1. **Array literal:** Omit a value when using the array literal
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', empty ,'Batman']
        ```
     2. **Array() constructor:** Invoking Array(length) or new Array(length)
        ```js
        const array = Array(3);
        console.log(array); // [empty, empty ,empty]
        ```
     3. **Delete operator:** Using delete array[index] operator on the array
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", "Batman"];
        delete justiceLeague[1];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', empty, ,'Batman']
        ```
     4. **Increase length property:** Increasing length property of an array
        `js const justiceLeague = ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman']; justiceLeague.length = 5; console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman', empty, empty] `
        **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

429. ### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
     3. **Process NextTick:** If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

430. ### How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?

     The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,

     ```javascript
     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();

     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.

     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**
        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**
        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**
        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {
          return [value, ...accumulator];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          return [...accumulator, value];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          accumulator.push(value);
          return accumulator;
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

431. ### How do you create custom HTML element?

     The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,

     1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.
        After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.
        **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.
        ```javascript
        class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
          connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = "This is a custom element";
          }
        }
        customElements.define("custom-element", CustomElement);
        ```
     2. **Use custome element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.

     ```javascript
        <body>
             <custom-element>
        </body>
     ```

432. ### What is global execution context?

     The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.

     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.

     ```javascript
     var x = 10;

     function A() {
       console.log("Start function A");

       function B() {
         console.log("In function B");
       }

       B();
     }

     A();

     console.log("GlobalContext");
     ```

433. ### What is function execution context?

     Whenever a function is invoked, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the Global Execution Context (GEC) to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

434. ### What is debouncing?

     Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new time—300 ms in the future.

     ```js
     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
       let timer;
       return (...args) => {
         clearTimeout(timer);
         timer = setTimeout(() => {
           func.apply(this, args);
         }, timeout);
       };
     }
     function fetchResults() {
       console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
     }
     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
     ```

     The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events

     **Input:**

     ```html
     <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
     ```

     **Button:**

     ```html
     <button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
     ```

     **Windows event:**

     ```html
     window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
     ```

435. ### What is throttling?

     Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling etc.

     The below example creates a throttle function to reduce the number of events for each pixel change and trigger scroll event for each 100ms except for the first event.

     ```js
     const throttle = (func, limit) => {
       let inThrottle;
       return (...args) => {
         if (!inThrottle) {
           func.apply(this, args);
           inThrottle = true;
           setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
         }
       };
     };
     window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
       throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100);
     });
     ```

### Coding Exercise

```javascript
var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: ReferenceError
- 3: null
- 4: {model: "Honda", color: "white", year: "2010", country: "UK"}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function declarations are hoisted similar to any variables. So the placement for `Vehicle` function declaration doesn't make any difference.

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the fist statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

##### Answer: 1

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise.

Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

The return value of `typeof myNumber (OR) typeof myString` is always the truthy value (either "number" or "string"). Since ! operator converts the value to a boolean value, the value of both `!typeof myNumber or !typeof myString` is always false. Hence the if condition fails and control goes to else block.

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

- 3: undefined
- 4: 0

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area();
```

##### Answer: 3

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

Spread syntax can be applied only to iterable objects. By default, Objects are not iterable, but they become iterable when used in an Array, or with iterating functions such as `map(), reduce(), and assign()`. If you still try to do it, it still throws `TypeError: obj is not iterable`.

##### Answer: 1

A return statement in a generator function will make the generator finish. If a value is returned, it will be set as the value property of the object and done property to true. When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls return an object of this form: `{value: undefined, done: true}`.

##### Answer: 4

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

- 4: 10, 10

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

 - 1: hi

- 3: getMessage is not defined
- 4: Undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error '`getMessage` is not a function' at the code execution phase.
